Ideal for showcasing your projects and skills, this template provides a streamlined starting point with fast refresh and clean code practices.

✨ Features
🖥️ React & Vite: A modern React setup with Vite, ensuring fast build times and efficient development.
⚡ Hot Module Replacement (HMR): Instant updates in the browser without losing state while you develop.
📝 ESLint Configuration: Pre-configured ESLint with type-aware rules for a cleaner, more maintainable codebase.
🔧 Easy Customization: Ready to be customized with your personal projects, skills, and experience.

🛠️ Technologies Used
React – A powerful, declarative JavaScript library for building UIs.
Vite – A fast, modern development tool for React apps.
ESLint – Ensures your code stays consistent and error-free.
SWC/Babel – Supports Fast Refresh during development.
🚀 Installation
Getting started with this React portfolio template is quick and simple:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone git@github.com:Alioune-Ndoye/React-Portfolio.git
cd React-Portfolio
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
npm install
Choose your Fast Refresh plugin:

For Babel (default):
bash
Copy
npm install @vitejs/plugin-react
For SWC (alternative, faster):
bash
Copy
npm install @vitejs/plugin-react-swc
Start the development server:

bash
Copy
npm run dev
Now you can open your app in the browser! The development server will automatically reload changes with HMR.

🧩 Expanding the ESLint Configuration
For production-ready code, enable type-aware linting to catch potential errors early:

Update the ESLint parser options to include your tsconfig files:

In eslint.config.js or .eslintrc.js, configure parserOptions like this:

js
Copy
export default tseslint.config({
  languageOptions: {
    // other options...
    parserOptions: {
      project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
    },
  },
});
Switch to stricter ESLint configurations: For more rigorous type checks, replace tseslint.configs.recommended with tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked or tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked.

Optionally, add stylistic rules:

js
Copy
...tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked
⚙️ Adding React Plugin for ESLint
To improve your React development with ESLint, use eslint-plugin-react:

Install eslint-plugin-react:

bash
Copy
npm install eslint-plugin-react --save-dev
Update ESLint config: In your eslint.config.js, add the following configuration:

js
Copy
import react from 'eslint-plugin-react'

export default tseslint.config({
  settings: {
    react: {
      version: '18.3',  // Ensure correct React version is used
    },
  },
  plugins: {
    react,  // Add the React plugin
  },
  rules: {
    // Enable recommended rules
    ...react.configs.recommended.rules,
    ...react.configs['jsx-runtime'].rules,
  },
});
💻 Usage
Run the app: After setting up, run the development server:

bash
Copy
npm run dev
Customize your portfolio:

Modify the App.js and Portfolio components to add your personal projects, skills, and experience.
Add your assets like images, CV, and other personal information.
